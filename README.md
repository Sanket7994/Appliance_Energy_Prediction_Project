<h2> :floppy_disk: Problem statement </h2>
The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters.Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non-predictive attributes.

<h2> :book: Random Forest Regressor </h2>
The extra trees algorithm, like the random forests algorithm, creates many decision trees, but the sampling for each tree is random, without replacement. This creates a dataset for each tree with unique samples. A specific number of features, from the total set of features, are also selected randomly for each tree.

<h2> :book: Steps performed On dataset and Conclusion </h2>

* As first step Performed data Preprocessing and clean the data, handled the missing values.

* Performed EDA on different features in dataset, to observe trend and relation between features.

* After the EDA part, for model prediction split the data in train and test.

* Train the data on some algorithms as Polynomial regression, Lasso regression, XGBoost regression, Extra Tree Regressor and Random forest Regressor, among all the Extra Tree Regressor gives the best performence on data.

* Extra Tree regressor gives the r2 score of 0.655 on test data.
